- Added contributors in "Settings/About" dialog.
- Updated wiiu_versionlist.txt.
- Added the .exe trying to rename itself back to normal after an attempt to rename the .exe to an unsupported name (breaks updates).

0.902 beta
- Removed the ability to rename the main .exe to "NUtSGrabberGUI.exe" or "DeezNUSGrabberGUI.exe" in order to put the program in debug mode.  Why did I let someone talk me into doing that?
- Fixed link to dropbox in message box that appears when an update fails.

0.901 beta
- Added actual language support.
- Changed dropbox link because the public folder is no longer functional.

0.90 beta

- Fixed a bug with HTML parsing - &#160; was not being taken out.
- Removed MSVCR120.DLL and MSVCP140.DLL, as they are not compatable with all systems.

0.88 beta

- Added the ability to search by Title ID.  To search, search only by the last 8 hex values (An example: 10115E00).

0.85 beta
- Added project to GitHub!

- Added more comments for others to understand the code better once it's open source.

0.83 beta

0.81 beta
- Removed the annoying "&amp;" in the description from parsed HTML.
- Re-re-fixed (hopefully) yet another part of the bug "Title not found." If it doesn't work past this, then use the archived version in the settings.
